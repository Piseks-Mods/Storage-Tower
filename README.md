# Pisek's Storage Tower

One day I was going home with my friend and we were talking about storage mods while walking. He suggested to me to create my own, so here it is. This storage system is friendly to use *(hopefully)* but unfriendly to build. This multi-block storage structure isn't any ordinary structure... it's a tower.

You build a tower made out of a Storage Crate and place a Storage Controler in the tower to access stored items. Each crate can store up to 2304 items (36 slots)... so after making some calculations one max tower (replacing bedrock) can hold up to 587520 items.

Unfortunately, I don't have the willpower to add a crafting interface. And there's no cloud - everything is stored in crates *(so don't break them while they're full)*.

## Other information:
* The only supported version of Minecraft is `1.16.5`. **Don't ask to upgrade!**

Made with **MCreator 2022.3**.
